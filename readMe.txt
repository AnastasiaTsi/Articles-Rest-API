#Building Process

To build the REST API at first i wrote down the different requirements. I Organized roughly how the 
REST API will be build and started. At first i worked on the backend. Im more detail created the modals
and the routes for the two entities. At the same time the public Mongo Instance was created.

After the backend was set i started working on the frontend of the REST API. I started building the components
with Material-ui.


#Pro's
I used modals from the Material ui to make the program look cleaner

#Con's
The way the program is build you can only edit the content of an article.
That means that if a category is deleted some articles have no category and a new one
cant be added.  

#Would be nice if it had
Cleaner code, cleaner components and some more generic components.

Show what error the user did when the request is invalid.

It would be nice if it was better designed
What i would change would be to add all the options at 
side bar that opens and close with a button
